* Utilities for Starcraft 2

Currently contains only one utility (=supply-block-graphs=) since I
promised someone on [[http://www.teamliquid.net/][teamliquid.net]] to put it online.

** Supply Block Graphs

This is still very much in a "hey, it works.. ship it!" state and
isn't quite as flexible as I would like.  Still very much geared to
the Zerg race.

The purpose is to show the effect of an (early) supply block on your
economy for the rest of the game.
